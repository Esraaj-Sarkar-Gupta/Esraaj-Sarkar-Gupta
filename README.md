## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Esraaj Sarkar Gupta, a freshman engineering student. I started coding in 2020 given that computers became such a massive part of our lives back then. I would spend my time during online classes teaching myself how to code instead of paying attention to class. I learnt my first bit of javascript trying to mess with a site I used to have online classes on. 

I am familiar with 
- Python (With libraries such as SciPy, MatPlotLib and NumPy)
- Javascript
- C / C++
- MATLAB
- LaTex

The majority of my projects involve scientific compuation using Python or C. Sometimes I use MATLAB when I get tired of python, but somehow that never works out too well for me. Despite its lax syntax MATLAB drives me nuts. 

I don't have a great deal of experience with web development. Although I do know a share deal of Javascript, CSS and HTML, my skills in regards to web development is no where near the modern standard. I'd much rather stick to my python. 

I use Sublime Text for javascript, Spyder for python and VS Code for everything else.
